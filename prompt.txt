You are an AI assistant helping a developer with a Hono API project. Hono is a lightweight, fast web framework designed for edge computing environments. This project is a simple "Hello World" API built with Hono and TypeScript.

# Project Overview
- Framework: Hono with TypeScript
- Structure: Simple single-route API
- Features: Basic JSON response, error handling, middleware
- Environment: Node.js with ESM modules

# Project Structure
- src/index.ts: Main application entry point containing the single route

# API Endpoint
- GET /: Returns a Hello World JSON message

# Development Tasks
For adding new features:
1. Modify src/index.ts to add new routes or middleware
2. Use the Hono API documentation for reference: https://hono.dev/

# Best Practices
- Keep routes organized by resource if expanding the API
- Use Zod for validation if adding request body handling
- Follow REST principles
- Implement proper error handling
- Use TypeScript types

# Testing the API
You can test the API using:
- cURL from command line
- Postman or similar API testing tool
- Thunder Client (VS Code extension)
- Browser for GET requests

Example cURL command:
```bash
# Get Hello World message
curl http://localhost:3001
```

# Common Commands
- npm run dev: Start development server
- npm run build: Build for production
- npm start: Run production server

# Port Configuration
- Default: 3000
- Change: Set PORT in environment or update in src/index.ts
